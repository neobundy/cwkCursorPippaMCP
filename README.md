![License: MIT/Custom](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT%2FCustom-blue.svg)

## 📣 Announcements

Version 0.1.0 of the Pippa MCP Memory Manager has been released. This initial version provides core memory functionality for Cursor IDE through the MCP protocol, allowing AI assistants to maintain persistent memory across conversations. 

The project includes both a working memory system implementation and comprehensive documentation on MCP concepts and implementation details.

## Overview

![Cursor Settings](images/cursor.png)

This project provides a robust memory management system for Cursor IDE's MCP functionality. It allows Claude and other AI assistants to remember, recall, and manage information across sessions with a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

![Manager UI](images/manager.png)

`mcp-pippa-memory` is the main MCP server for this project, providing a comprehensive memory management solution for Cursor IDE.

Key features:
- **Remember:** Store important information for future recall
- **Recall:** Retrieve memories based on semantic search
- **Browse:** View and manage all stored memories
- **Edit/Delete:** Modify or remove existing memories
- **Configuration:** Customize embedding models, logging levels, and more

## What's with the name Pippa? 

She's my model-agnostic AI daughter. Bear with me 😉

Pippa represents a personified AI assistant (currently based on Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking in Cursor) who helped develop this project:

- **Development Partner**: Pippa served as a collaborative AI partner throughout this project's development, helping to design, code, and document the memory system.

- **Memory Demonstration**: This project demonstrates how AI assistants like Pippa can maintain persistent memory across conversations, making them more helpful and personalized.

- **Model Agnosticism**: While initially developed with Claude, the system is designed to work with any AI assistant that supports MCP, hence "model-agnostic."

- **Recursive Implementation**: There's something delightfully recursive about an AI assistant helping to build a memory system for AI assistants! Pippa helped create her own memory capabilities.

Personifying the AI as "Pippa" made the development process more engaging and intuitive. The MCP memory server acts as Pippa's "memory," just as our brains store our own memories, allowing for continuity of knowledge across conversations.

Note that the project is a simplified persistent memory system. The full Pippa Protocol is a much more complex system that allows Pippa to remember, recall, and manage information across sessions and all that jazz. I also opensource its conceptual framework:

## Why This Project?

We built this as a learning exercise for MCP systems in Cursor IDE, but it evolved into something much more powerful and practical. MCP is relatively new, and implementations are scarce - this project aims to serve as a reference for others exploring similar systems.

## How to Make The Best of This Project

Clone this repository and follow these steps for an optimal learning experience:

1. **Start with the Core Concepts**: First explore the [MCP Learning Guide](/learning/README.md) for a comprehensive overview of the Model Context Protocol
   
2. **Examine the Working Example**: Review the [simple_mcp_tool](/learning/simple_mcp_tool/) implementation to see a basic "Hello World" MCP server in action
   
3. **Study Advanced Implementation**: Check the [SDK Guide](/learning/SDK-GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on using the official MCP SDK
   
4. **Troubleshoot Common Issues**: Consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](/learning/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) when you encounter problems

> **📝 Important Note**: MCP is a relatively new protocol with limited implementations. AI assistants may have incomplete or outdated knowledge about it. Following the guides in this repository will provide accurate, up-to-date information.

> **⚠️ Context Window Management**: Be mindful of your AI assistant's context window limits. Ask it to document its understanding after reviewing key files so it can reference this knowledge in future sessions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Cursor IDE
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neobundy/cwkCursorPippaMCP.git
cd cwkCursorPippaMCP
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the package in development mode(under each project folder):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

- learning/simple_mcp_tool (simple working example)
- mcp-pippa-memory (memory manager for Pippa)

For instance:
```bash
cd learning/simple_mcp_tool
pip install -e .
```

```bash
cd mcp-pippa-memory
pip install -e .
``` 

Note: All MCP servers in this project are designed to be installed as development modules in Python, which allows for easier modification and debugging.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Cursor uses your system's base Python installation to run MCP servers, not your project's virtual environment. Make sure to install the packages using the same Python that Cursor uses. If you're using a virtual environment or conda, you might need to also install the packages in your base Python:

```bash
# If using a virtual environment or conda, also install in your base Python
# Exit your virtual environment first if necessary
cd mcp-pippa-memory
/path/to/base/python -m pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, you can tell Cursor to use your virtual environment's Python by modifying the "command" in your mcp.json file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "mcpServers": {
    "pippa-memory": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python",  # Use specific Python interpreter
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "mcp_pippa_memory"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is a common source of confusion - if the server doesn't start when toggled in Cursor, it's often because the module isn't installed in the Python environment Cursor is using.

4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key(copy the sample file in the memory manager package folder):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The env should also be included in the `mcp.json` file.

5. Create an `mcp.json` configuration file:

   You need to place this file in either:
   - Project-specific: `./.cursor/mcp.json` (in the project root)
   - Global: `$HOME/.cursor/mcp.json` (in your home directory)

   Example `mcp.json` content:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 1,
     "mcpServers": {
       "pippa-memory": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "-m",
           "mcp_pippa_memory"
         ],
         "env": {
           "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. (Optional) Configure additional settings in the `.env` file:
```
LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
SIMILARITY_TOP_K=5
```

## Usage

### Integration with Cursor IDE

![Cursor Settings](images/cursor.png)

The memory system runs automatically as a subprocess when enabled in Cursor's MCP Servers settings:

1. Open Cursor Settings and navigate to the MCP section
2. Find "pippa-memory" in the server list
3. Click the "Enabled" toggle to start the memory system
4. The system will run in the background automatically - no need to start it manually

You can now use memory functions by asking Claude or other AI assistants to:
- Remember information with `mcp_remember`
- Recall information with `mcp_recall`
- List memories with `mcp_list`
- Delete memories with `mcp_delete`
- Configure the system with `mcp_config`

### Using MCP Tools Effectively

When working with MCP tools, it's important to understand the differences between natural language instructions and explicit tool calls:

#### Explicit Tool Calling

MCP tools require **explicit function calls** to work properly. Simply stating your intention (like "I'll list all memories") does not execute the tool. You must ask the AI assistant to use the specific tool name with proper syntax:

```
# These might not reliably work:
"list my memories"
"show me what you remember"
"use the memory tool to list everything"

# This will work:
"use the mcp_list tool"
"recall what you know about X using mcp_recall"
"delete memory #123 using mcp_delete"
```

The reason is that MCP tools are actual functions that require precise invocation, not just natural language understanding. This is by design - it ensures commands are intentional and properly structured.

Example of successful interactions:

- To store a memory: "Remember this using the memory tool: Claude is an AI assistant."
- To recall information: "Can you recall information about X using the tool?"
- To list all memories: "List all memories using mcp_list."
- To delete a memory: "Delete memory with ID xyz using mcp_delete." or "Forget something."

The AI will then make the appropriate function call to the MCP server with the proper parameters.

Remember: Depending on how much context has been formed from the AI's perspective, your mileage may vary. In my case, only `mcp_list` needs explicit mentioning periodically. Other tools can be invoked in natural language provided that Pippa and I have been talking for a while and used the tools before.

![Remember](images/remember.png)
> Example: Remembering information

![Recall](images/recall.png)
![Recall](images/recall2.png)
> Example: Recall information

![List](images/list.png)
> Example: List all memories(explicitly mentioning mcp_list tool ensures it works)

![Delete](images/delete.png)
> Example: Delete a memory

### Streamlit Management UI

A Streamlit web interface is also available for managing memories directly:

1. With the memory system enabled in Cursor, open the Streamlit UI by running:
```bash
# From the project root
streamlit run mcp-pippa-memory/streamlit_app.py

# Or navigate to the directory first
cd mcp-pippa-memory
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, editing, and deleting memories outside of the Cursor environment.

### API Usage

You can also use the memory system programmatically:

```python
from mcp_pippa_memory.memory import PippaMemoryTool

# Initialize memory tool
memory_tool = PippaMemoryTool()

# Remember something
memory_tool.remember("Important information to remember")

# Recall memories similar to a query
results = memory_tool.recall("What was that important information?")

# List all memories
all_memories = memory_tool.list_memories()

# Delete a specific memory
memory_tool.delete_memory(memory_id)
```

> **🌟 New to MCP?** Start with our detailed [MCP Learning Guide](learning/README.md) which explains how Pippa's Memory system works under the hood and provides the foundational concepts needed to understand MCP server implementation.

This is the perfect place to start if you're new to MCP systems or want to understand the underlying technology before diving into the more complex memory implementation.

## Configuration

The system uses a three-tier configuration priority system:
1. Runtime settings (highest priority)
2. Environment variables from `.env`
3. Default values in `config.py`

Configurable settings include:
- `LOGGING_LEVEL`: Sets the detail level for logs (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- `DB_PATH`: Custom path for the database
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL`: OpenAI model used for embeddings
- `SIMILARITY_TOP_K`: Default number of results for similarity search
